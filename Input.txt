Do not pass objects to functions by value;
if the objects handle dynamic memory (i.e., heap memory)
do not ever pass objects to functions by value;
instead pass by reference, or even better, pass by const reference. 

But if you must pass these objects by value, 
make sure that the class of these objects defines 
a copy constructor, 
a copy assignment operator, 
and a destructor. 
That's called the Rule of Three, or the Big Three,
and is emphasized in the C++ literature over and over and over again!
